 * @brief HW_ADC_SC1n - ADC Status and Control Registers 1 (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x0000001FU
 *
 * SC1A is used for both software and hardware trigger modes of operation. To
 * allow sequential conversions of the ADC to be triggered by internal peripherals,
 * the ADC can have more then one status and control register: one for each
 * conversion. The SC1B-SC1n registers indicate potentially multiple SC1 registers
 * for use only in hardware trigger mode. See the chip configuration information
 * about the number of SC1n registers specific to this device. The SC1n registers
 * have identical fields, and are used in a "ping-pong" approach to control ADC
 * operation. At any one point in time, only one of the SC1n registers is actively
 * controlling ADC conversions. Updating SC1A while SC1n is actively controlling
 * a conversion is allowed, and vice-versa for any of the SC1n registers specific
 * to this MCU. Writing SC1A while SC1A is actively controlling a conversion
 * aborts the current conversion. In Software Trigger mode, when SC2[ADTRG]=0,
 * writes to SC1A subsequently initiate a new conversion, if SC1[ADCH] contains a
 * value other than all 1s. Writing any of the SC1n registers while that specific
 * SC1n register is actively controlling a conversion aborts the current conversion.
 * None of the SC1B-SC1n registers are used for software trigger operation and
 * therefore writes to the SC1B-SC1n registers do not initiate a new conversion.

 * Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the
 * value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and
 * DADMx. Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might
 * not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for
 * your device, see the Chip Configuration details. The successive approximation
 * converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set,
 * that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and
 * isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous
 * conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It
 * is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state
 * when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically
 * enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

 * In master transmit mode, when data is written to this register, a data
 * transfer is initiated. The most significant bit is sent first. In master receive
 * mode, reading this register initiates receiving of the next byte of data. When
 * making the transition out of master receive mode, switch the I2C mode before
 * reading the Data register to prevent an inadvertent initiation of a master
 * receive data transfer. In slave mode, the same functions are available after an
 * address match occurs. The C1[TX] bit must correctly reflect the desired direction
 * of transfer in master and slave modes for the transmission to begin. For
 * example, if the I2C module is configured for master transmit but a master receive
 * is desired, reading the Data register does not initiate the receive. Reading
 * the Data register returns the last byte received while the I2C module is
 * configured in master receive or slave receive mode. The Data register does not
 * reflect every byte that is transmitted on the I2C bus, and neither can software
 * verify that a byte has been written to the Data register correctly by reading it
 * back. In master transmit mode, the first byte of data written to the Data
 * register following assertion of MST (start bit) or assertion of RSTA (repeated
 * start bit) is used for the address transfer and must consist of the calling
 * address (in bits 7-1) concatenated with the required R/W bit (in position bit 0).

 * reception is occurring. The following scenario explains the holdoff
 * functionality: The I2C module is configured for a basic transfer, and the SHEN bit is set
 * to 1. A transfer begins. The MCU signals the I2C module to enter stop mode. The
 * byte currently being transferred, including both address and data, completes
 * its transfer. The I2C slave or master acknowledges that the in-transfer byte
 * completed its transfer and acknowledges the request to enter stop mode. After
 * receiving the I2C module's acknowledgment of the request to enter stop mode,
 * the MCU determines whether to shut off the I2C module's clock. If the SHEN bit
 * is set to 1 and the I2C module is in an idle or disabled state when the MCU
 * signals to enter stop mode, the module immediately acknowledges the request to
 * enter stop mode. If SHEN is cleared to 0 and the overall data transmission or
 * reception that was suspended by stop mode entry was incomplete: To resume the
 * overall transmission or reception after the MCU exits stop mode, software must
 * reinitialize the transfer by resending the address of the slave. If the I2C
 * Control Register 1's IICIE bit was set to 1 before the MCU entered stop mode,
 * system software will receive the interrupt triggered by the I2C Status Register's
 * TCF bit after the MCU wakes from the stop mode.
 *
 * Values:
 * - 0 - Stop holdoff is disabled. The MCU's entry to stop mode is not gated.
 * - 1 - Stop holdoff is enabled.

 *
 * LLWU_F1 contains the wakeup flags indicating which wakeup source caused the
 * MCU to exit LLS or VLLS mode. For LLS, this is the source causing the CPU
 * interrupt flow. For VLLS, this is the source causing the MCU reset flow. The
 * external wakeup flags are read-only and clearing a flag is accomplished by a write
 * of a 1 to the corresponding WUFx bit. The wakeup flag (WUFx), if set, will
 * remain set if the associated WUPEx bit is cleared. This register is reset on Chip
 * Reset not VLLS and by reset types that trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. It is
 * unaffected by reset types that do not trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. See the
 * Introduction details for more information.

 * remain set if the associated WUPEx bit is cleared. This register is reset on Chip
 * Reset not VLLS and by reset types that trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. It is
 * unaffected by reset types that do not trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. See the

 *     out. In slave mode of operation: MISO is slave out and MOSI is slave in.
 * - 1 - SPI configured for single-wire bidirectional operation (pin mode is
 *     bidirectional). In master mode of operation: MISO is not used by SPI; MOSI is
 *     master in when BIDIROE is 0 or master I/O when BIDIROE is 1. In slave
 *     mode of operation: MISO is slave in when BIDIROE is 0 or slave I/O when

 * has completed. The SPTEF bit in the S register indicates when the transmit data
 * buffer is ready to accept new data. When the transmit DMA request is disabled
 * (TXDMAE is 0): The S register must be read when SPTEF is set before writing to
 * the SPI data register; otherwise, the write is ignored. When the transmit DMA
 * request is enabled (TXDMAE is 1) when SPTEF is set, the SPI data register can
 * be written automatically by DMA without reading the S register first. Data
 * may be read from the SPI data register any time after SPRF is set and before
 * another transfer is finished. Failure to read the data out of the receive data
 * buffer before a new transfer ends causes a receive overrun condition, and the
 * data from the new transfer is lost. The new data is lost because the receive
 * buffer still held the previous character and was not ready to accept the new
 * data. There is no indication for a receive overrun condition, so the application
 * system designer must ensure that previous data has been read from the receive
 * buffer before a new transfer is initiated.

 * This register contains one read-only status flag. When using an internal

 * one bit time. Under the worst case timing conditions allowed in LIN, it is
 * possible that a 0x00 data character can appear to be 10.26 bit times long at a
 * slave running 14% faster than the master. This would trigger normal break
 * detection circuitry designed to detect a 10-bit break symbol. When the LBKDE bit is
 * set, framing errors are inhibited and the break detection threshold
 * increases, preventing false detection of a 0x00 data character as a LIN break symbol.

 * @brief HW_USB_SOFTHLD - SOF Threshold Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The SOF Threshold Register is used only in Host mode (HOSTMODEEN=1). When in
 * Host mode, the 14-bit SOF counter counts the interval between SOF frames. The
 * SOF must be transmitted every 1ms so therefore the SOF counter is loaded with
 * a value of 12000. When the SOF counter reaches zero, a Start Of Frame (SOF)
 * token is transmitted. The SOF threshold register is used to program the number
 * of USB byte times before the SOF to stop initiating token packet transactions.
 * This register must be set to a value that ensures that other packets are not
 * actively being transmitted when the SOF time counts to zero. When the SOF
 * counter reaches the threshold value, no more tokens are transmitted until after the
 * SOF has been transmitted. The value programmed into the threshold register
 * must reserve enough time to ensure the worst case transaction completes. In
 * general the worst case transaction is an IN token followed by a data packet from
 * the target followed by the response from the host. The actual time required is
 * a function of the maximum packet size on the bus. Typical values for the SOF
 * threshold are: 64-byte packets=74; 32-byte packets=42; 16-byte packets=26;
 * 8-byte packets=18.
