/*!
 * @brief HW_ADC_SC1n - ADC Status and Control Registers 1 (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x0000001FU
 *
 * SC1A is used for both software and hardware trigger modes of operation. To
 * allow sequential conversions of the ADC to be triggered by internal peripherals,
 * the ADC can have more than one status and control register: one for each
 * conversion. The SC1B-SC1n registers indicate potentially multiple SC1 registers
 * for use only in hardware trigger mode. See the chip configuration information
 * about the number of SC1n registers specific to this device. The SC1n registers
 * have identical fields, and are used in a "ping-pong" approach to control ADC
 * operation. At any one point in time, only one of the SC1n registers is actively
 * controlling ADC conversions. Updating SC1A while SC1n is actively controlling
 * a conversion is allowed, and vice-versa for any of the SC1n registers specific
 * to this MCU. Writing SC1A while SC1A is actively controlling a conversion
 * aborts the current conversion. In Software Trigger mode, when SC2[ADTRG]=0,
 * writes to SC1A subsequently initiate a new conversion, if SC1[ADCH] contains a
 * value other than all 1s. Writing any of the SC1n registers while that specific
 * SC1n register is actively controlling a conversion aborts the current conversion.
 * None of the SC1B-SC1n registers are used for software trigger operation and
 * therefore writes to the SC1B-SC1n registers do not initiate a new conversion.

 * Selects one of the input channels. The input channel decode depends on the
 * value of DIFF. DAD0-DAD3 are associated with the input pin pairs DADPx and
 * DADMx. Some of the input channel options in the bitfield-setting descriptions might
 * not be available for your device. For the actual ADC channel assignments for
 * your device, see the Chip Configuration details. The successive approximation
 * converter subsystem is turned off when the channel select bits are all set,
 * that is, ADCH = 11111. This feature allows explicit disabling of the ADC and
 * isolation of the input channel from all sources. Terminating continuous
 * conversions this way prevents an additional single conversion from being performed. It
 * is not necessary to set ADCH to all 1s to place the ADC in a low-power state
 * when continuous conversions are not enabled because the module automatically
 * enters a low-power state when a conversion completes.

 * Reset value: 0xFFFFFFFFU
 *
 * The CRC Data register contains the value of the seed, data, and checksum.
 * When CTRL[WAS] is set, any write to the data register is regarded as the seed
 * value. When CTRL[WAS] is cleared, any write to the data register is regarded as
 * data for general CRC computation. In 16-bit CRC mode, the HU and HL fields are
 * not used for programming the seed value, and reads of these fields return an
 * indeterminate value. In 32-bit CRC mode, all fields are used for programming
 * the seed value. When programming data values, the values can be written 8 bits,
 * 16 bits, or 32 bits at a time, provided all bytes are contiguous; with MSB of
 * data value written first. After all data values are written, the CRC result
 * can be read from this data register. In 16-bit CRC mode, the CRC result is
 * available in the LU and LL fields. In 32-bit CRC mode, all fields contain the
 * result. Reads of this register at any time return the intermediate CRC value,
 * provided the CRC module is configured.

/*!
 * @brief HW_DMA_CR - Control Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The CR defines the basic operating configuration of the DMA. Arbitration can
 * be configured to use either a fixed-priority or a round-robin scheme. For
 * fixed-priority arbitration, the highest priority channel requesting service is
 * selected to execute. The channel priority registers assign the priorities; see
 * the DCHPRIn registers. For round-robin arbitration, the channel priorities are
 * ignored and channels are cycled through (from high to low channel number)
 * without regard to priority. For proper operation, writes to the CR register must be
 * performed only when the DMA channels are inactive; that is, when
 * TCDn_CSR[ACTIVE] bits are cleared. Minor loop offsets are address offset values added to
 * the final source address (TCDn_SADDR) or destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion. When minor loop offsets are enabled, the minor loop
 * offset (MLOFF) is added to the final source address (TCDn_SADDR), to the final
 * destination address (TCDn_DADDR), or to both prior to the addresses being
 * written back into the TCD. If the major loop is complete, the minor loop offset is
 * ignored and the major loop address offsets (TCDn_SLAST and TCDn_DLAST_SGA) are
 * used to compute the next TCDn_SADDR and TCDn_DADDR values. When minor loop
 * mapping is enabled (EMLM is 1), TCDn word2 is redefined. A portion of TCDn word2
 * is used to specify multiple fields: a source enable bit (SMLOE) to specify the
 * minor loop offset should be applied to the source address (TCDn_SADDR) upon
 * minor loop completion, a destination enable bit (DMLOE) to specify the minor
 * loop offset should be applied to the destination address (TCDn_DADDR) upon minor
 * loop completion, and the sign extended minor loop offset value (MLOFF). The
 * same offset value (MLOFF) is used for both source and destination minor loop
 * offsets. When either minor loop offset is enabled (SMLOE set or DMLOE set), the
 * NBYTES field is reduced to 10 bits. When both minor loop offsets are disabled
 * (SMLOE cleared and DMLOE cleared), the NBYTES field is a 30-bit vector. When
 * minor loop mapping is disabled (EMLM is 0), all 32 bits of TCDn word2 are
 * assigned to the NBYTES field.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The ERQ register provides a bit map for the 16 implemented channels to enable
 * the request signal for each channel. The state of any given channel enable is
 * directly affected by writes to this register; it is also affected by writes
 * to the SERQ and CERQ. The {S,C}ERQ registers are provided so the request enable
 * for a single channel can easily be modified without needing to perform a
 * read-modify-write sequence to the ERQ. DMA request input signals and this enable
 * request flag must be asserted before a channel's hardware service request is
 * accepted. The state of the DMA enable request flag does not affect a channel
 * service request made explicitly through software or a linked channel request.

 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The EEI register provides a bit map for the 16 channels to enable the error
 * interrupt signal for each channel. The state of any given channel's error
 * interrupt enable is directly affected by writes to this register; it is also
 * affected by writes to the SEEI and CEEI. The {S,C}EEI are provided so the error
 * interrupt enable for a single channel can easily be modified without the need to
 * perform a read-modify-write sequence to the EEI register. The DMA error
 * indicator and the error interrupt enable flag must be asserted before an error
 * interrupt request for a given channel is asserted to the interrupt controller.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The CINT provides a simple, memory-mapped mechanism to clear a given bit in
 * the INT to disable the interrupt request for a given channel. The given value
 * on a register write causes the corresponding bit in the INT to be cleared.
 * Setting the CAIR bit provides a global clear function, forcing the entire contents
 * of the INT to be cleared, disabling all DMA interrupt requests. If the NOP
 * bit is set, the command is ignored. This allows you to write multiple-byte
 * registers as a 32-bit word. Reads of this register return all zeroes.

/*!
 * @brief HW_DMA_INT - Interrupt Request Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The INT register provides a bit map for the 16 channels signaling the
 * presence of an interrupt request for each channel. Depending on the appropriate bit
 * setting in the transfer-control descriptors, the eDMA engine generates an
 * interrupt on data transfer completion. The outputs of this register are directly
 * routed to the interrupt controller (INTC). During the interrupt-service routine
 * associated with any given channel, it is the software's responsibility to
 * clear the appropriate bit, negating the interrupt request. Typically, a write to
 * the CINT register in the interrupt service routine is used for this purpose.
 * The state of any given channel's interrupt request is directly affected by
 * writes to this register; it is also affected by writes to the CINT register. On
 * writes to INT, a 1 in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's
 * interrupt request. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding
 * channel's current interrupt status. The CINT register is provided so the interrupt
 * request for a single channel can easily be cleared without the need to
 * perform a read-modify-write sequence to the INT register.

 ******************************************************************************/

/*!
 * @brief HW_DMA_ERR - Error Register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00000000U
 *
 * The ERR provides a bit map for the 16 channels, signaling the presence of an
 * error for each channel. The eDMA engine signals the occurrence of an error
 * condition by setting the appropriate bit in this register. The outputs of this
 * register are enabled by the contents of the EEI, and then routed to the
 * interrupt controller. During the execution of the interrupt-service routine associated
 * with any DMA errors, it is software's responsibility to clear the appropriate
 * bit, negating the error-interrupt request. Typically, a write to the CERR in
 * the interrupt-service routine is used for this purpose. The normal DMA channel
 * completion indicators (setting the transfer control descriptor DONE flag and
 * the possible assertion of an interrupt request) are not affected when an error
 * is detected. The contents of this register can also be polled because a
 * non-zero value indicates the presence of a channel error regardless of the state of
 * the EEI. The state of any given channel's error indicators is affected by
 * writes to this register; it is also affected by writes to the CERR. On writes to
 * the ERR, a one in any bit position clears the corresponding channel's error
 * status. A zero in any bit position has no affect on the corresponding channel's
 * current error status. The CERR is provided so the error indicator for a single
 * channel can easily be cleared.

 * The HRS register provides a bit map for the DMA channels, signaling the

 * reflect the current state of the register and qualified (via the ERQ fields)
 * DMA request signals as seen by the DMA's arbitration logic. This view into the
 * hardware request signals may be used for debug purposes. These bits reflect the
 * state of the request as seen by the arbitration logic. Therefore, this status
 * is affected by the ERQ bits.

 *
 * The FPROT registers define which logical program flash regions are protected
 * from program and erase operations. Protected flash regions cannot have their
 * content changed; that is, these regions cannot be programmed and cannot be
 * erased by any flash command. Unprotected regions can be changed by program and
 * erase operations. The four FPROT registers allow up to 32 protectable regions.
 * Each bit protects a 1/32 region of the program flash memory except for memory
 * configurations with less than 32 KB of program flash where each assigned bit
 * protects 1 KB . For configurations with 24 KB of program flash memory or less,
 * FPROT0 is not used. For configurations with 16 KB of program flash memory or
 * less, FPROT1 is not used. For configurations with 8 KB of program flash memory,
 * FPROT2 is not used. The bitfields are defined in each register as follows:
 * Program flash protection register Program flash protection bits FPROT0 PROT[31:24]
 * FPROT1 PROT[23:16] FPROT2 PROT[15:8] FPROT3 PROT[7:0] During the reset

 * all enabled channels simultaneously. The use of the loading point selection
 * together with SYNCMODE = 0 and hardware trigger selection, TRIG0, TRIG1, or TRIG2

 * is desired, reading the Data register does not initiate the receive. Reading
 * the Data register returns the last byte received while the I2C module is
 * configured in master receive or slave receive mode. The Data register does not
 * reflect every byte that is transmitted on the I2C bus, and neither can software
 * verify that a byte has been written to the Data register correctly by reading it
 * back. In master transmit mode, the first byte of data written to the Data

 * to 1. A transfer begins. The MCU signals the I2C module to enter stop mode. The
 * byte currently being transferred, including both address and data, completes
 * its transfer. The I2C slave or master acknowledges that the in-transfer byte
 * completed its transfer and acknowledges the request to enter stop mode. After
 * receiving the I2C module's acknowledgment of the request to enter stop mode,
 * the MCU determines whether to shut off the I2C module's clock. If the SHEN bit
 * is set to 1 and the I2C module is in an idle or disabled state when the MCU
 * signals to enter stop mode, the module immediately acknowledges the request to
 * enter stop mode. If SHEN is cleared to 0 and the overall data transmission or
 * reception that was suspended by stop mode entry was incomplete: To resume the
 * overall transmission or reception after the MCU exits stop mode, software must
 * reinitialize the transfer by resending the address of the slave. If the I2C
 * Control Register 1's IICIE bit was set to 1 before the MCU entered stop mode,
 * system software will receive the interrupt triggered by the I2C Status Register's
 * TCF bit after the MCU wakes from the stop mode.
 *
 * Values:
 * - 0 - Stop holdoff is disabled. The MCU's entry to stop mode is not gated.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * LLWU_F1 contains the wakeup flags indicating which wakeup source caused the

 * remain set if the associated WUPEx bit is cleared. This register is reset on Chip
 * Reset not VLLS and by reset types that trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. It is

 * LLWU_F3 contains the wakeup flags indicating which internal wakeup source

 * in the peripheral instead of writing a 1 to the MWUFx bit. This register is
 * reset on Chip Reset not VLLS and by reset types that trigger Chip Reset not

 * This register provides protection for entry into any low-power run or stop

 * Power Mode Control register (PMCTRL). The PMPROT register can be written only
 * once after any system reset. If the MCU is configured for a disallowed or

 * MCU is in normal RUN mode and AVLP is 0, an attempt to enter VLPR mode using
 * PMCTRL[RUNM] is blocked and PMCTRL[RUNM] remains 00b, indicating the MCU is
 * still in Normal Run mode. This register is reset on Chip Reset not VLLS and by
 * reset types that trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. It is unaffected by reset types
 * that do not trigger Chip Reset not VLLS. See the Reset section details for more
 * information.

 * generation for details. The baud rate generator is disabled until C2[TE] or
 * C2[RE] is set for the first time after reset.The baud rate generator is disabled
 * when SBR = 0. Writing to BDH has no effect without writing to BDL, because
 * writing to BDH puts the data in a temporary location until BDL is written. When
 * the 1/32 narrow pulse width is selected for infrared (IrDA), the baud rate
 * fields must be even, the least significant bit is 0. See MODEM register for more
 * details.

 *
 * Reset value: 0xC0U
 *
 * The S1 register provides inputs to the MCU for generation of UART interrupts
 * or DMA requests. This register can also be polled by the MCU to check the
 * status of its fields. To clear a flag, the status register should be read followed
 * by a read or write to D register, depending on the interrupt flag type. Other
 * instructions can be executed between the two steps as long the handling of
 * I/O is not compromised, but the order of operations is important for flag
 * clearing. When a flag is configured to trigger a DMA request, assertion of the
 * associated DMA done signal from the DMA controller clears the flag. If the
 * condition that results in the assertion of the flag, interrupt, or DMA request is not
 * resolved prior to clearing the flag, the flag, and interrupt/DMA request,
 * reasserts. For example, if the DMA or interrupt service routine fails to write
 * sufficient data to the transmit buffer to raise it above the watermark level, the
 * flag reasserts and generates another interrupt or DMA request. Reading an
 * empty data register to clear one of the flags of the S1 register causes the FIFO
 * pointers to become misaligned. A receive FIFO flush reinitializes the
 * pointers. A better way to prevent this situation is to always leave one byte in FIFO
 * and this byte will be read eventually in clearing the flag bit.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * This register is actually two separate registers. Reads return the contents
 * of the read-only receive data register and writes go to the write-only transmit
 * data register. In 8-bit or 9-bit data format, only UART data register (D)
 * needs to be accessed to clear the S1[RDRF] bit (assuming receiver buffer level is
 * less than RWFIFO[RXWATER]). The C3 register needs to be read, prior to the D
 * register, only if the ninth bit of data needs to be captured. Similarly, the
 * ED register needs to be read, prior to the D register, only if the additional
 * flag data for the dataword needs to be captured. In the normal 8-bit mode (M
 * bit cleared) if the parity is enabled, you get seven data bits and one parity
 * bit. That one parity bit is loaded into the D register. So, for the data bits,
 * mask off the parity bit from the value you read out of this register. When
 * transmitting in 9-bit data format and using 8-bit write instructions, write first
 * to transmit bit 8 in UART control register 3 (C3[T8]), then D. A write to
 * C3[T8] stores the data in a temporary register. If D register is written first,
 * and then the new data on data bus is stored in D, the temporary value written by
 * the last write to C3[T8] gets stored in the C3[T8] register.

 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The IS7816 register provides a mechanism to read and clear the interrupt
 * flags. All flags/interrupts are cleared by writing a 1 to the field location.
 * Writing a 0 has no effect. All bits are "sticky", meaning they indicate that only
 * the flag condition that occurred since the last time the bit was cleared, not
 * that the condition currently exists. The status flags are set regardless of
 * whether the corresponding field in the IE7816 is set or cleared. The IE7816
 * controls only if an interrupt is issued to the host processor. This register is
 * specific to 7816 functionality and the values in this register have no affect on
 * UART operation and should be ignored if 7816E is not set/enabled. This
 * register may be read or written at anytime.

 * This value plus four indicates the number of characters contained in the
 * block being transmitted. This register is automatically decremented by 1 for each
 * character in the information field portion of the block. Additionally, this
 * register is automatically decremented by 1 for the first character of a CRC in
 * the epilogue field. Therefore, this register must be programmed with the number
 * of bytes in the data packet if an LRC is being transmitted, and the number of
 * bytes + 1 if a CRC is being transmitted. This register is not decremented for
 * characters that are assumed to be part of the Prologue field, that is, the
 * first three characters transmitted in a block, or the LRC or last CRC character
 * in the Epilogue field, that is, the last character transmitted. This field
 * must be programed or adjusted only when C2[TE] is cleared.

 * Reports the transaction status within the USB module. When the processor's
 * interrupt controller has received a TOKDNE, interrupt the Status Register must
 * be read to determine the status of the previous endpoint communication. The
 * data in the status register is valid when TOKDNE interrupt is asserted. The
 * Status register is actually a read window into a status FIFO maintained by the USB
 * module. When the USB module uses a BD, it updates the Status register. If
 * another USB transaction is performed before the TOKDNE interrupt is serviced, the
 * USB module stores the status of the next transaction in the STAT FIFO. Thus
 * STAT is actually a four byte FIFO that allows the processor core to process one
 * transaction while the SIE is processing the next transaction. Clearing the
 * TOKDNE bit in the ISTAT register causes the SIE to update STAT with the contents
 * of the next STAT value. If the data in the STAT holding register is valid, the
 * SIE immediately reasserts to TOKDNE interrupt.

 * @brief HW_USB_SOFTHLD - SOF Threshold register (RW)
 *
 * Reset value: 0x00U
 *
 * The SOF Threshold Register is used only in Host mode (HOSTMODEEN=1). When in
 * Host mode, the 14-bit SOF counter counts the interval between SOF frames. The
 * SOF must be transmitted every 1ms so therefore the SOF counter is loaded with
 * a value of 12000. When the SOF counter reaches zero, a Start Of Frame (SOF)
 * token is transmitted. The SOF threshold register is used to program the number
 * of USB byte times before the SOF to stop initiating token packet transactions.
 * This register must be set to a value that ensures that other packets are not
 * actively being transmitted when the SOF time counts to zero. When the SOF
 * counter reaches the threshold value, no more tokens are transmitted until after the
 * SOF has been transmitted. The value programmed into the threshold register
 * must reserve enough time to ensure the worst case transaction completes. In
 * general the worst case transaction is an IN token followed by a data packet from
 * the target followed by the response from the host. The actual time required is
 * a function of the maximum packet size on the bus. Typical values for the SOF
 * threshold are: 64-byte packets=74; 32-byte packets=42; 16-byte packets=26;
 * 8-byte packets=18.
